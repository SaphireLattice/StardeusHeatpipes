# Saphire's Heatpipes mod for Stardeus

This is very much not based on the [kodolinija/stardeus-mod-template](https://github.com/kodolinija/stardeus-mod-template), though do take a look at it.

I've decided to go for a plain csproj setup, without usiing scripts to manage the build output and such. As a plus, cleaner source directory!

## Building for dev

Should be just `dotnet build`, or the building method of your preference

Then copy the output folder's content to the Mods folder of the game for testing
